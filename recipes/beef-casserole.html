    <h2>The delicious beef casserole you are about to create</h2>

    <p>My grandmother's old-fashioned hamburger casserole is comfort food at its best! Featuring ground beef, noodles, and a creamy cheese sauce, this simple recipe dates back to the 1940's. I've tweaked the amount of cheese and sour cream depending on what I've got in the fridge and it always turns out great! My mother has suggested this was made up as a way to use up ingredients in the fridge.</p>
